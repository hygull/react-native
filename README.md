# React Native

A JavaScript framework for building native mobile applications(apps).

### Prerequisites

1) Basic React JS knowledge

2) Solid JavaScript knowledge

### With React Native we 

1)	build mobile apps using only JavaScript.

2)	don't build a mobile web app, an HTML5 app, or a hybrid app. 

3)	build a real mobile app that's indistinguishable from an app built using Objective-C or Java.

4)	React Native uses the same fundamental **UI building blocks** as regular iOS and Android apps. You just put those **building blocks** together using JavaScript and React.
